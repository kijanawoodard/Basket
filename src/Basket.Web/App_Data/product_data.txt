The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation.

The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation.

And, of course, it can go straight to the tabletop. Because of its unique design qualities, it provides the convenience of fewer pots to clean, easy clean-up in the dishwasher, one pot meals — mix, sauté, brown, cook, serve, and clean up! It is healthy cooking made easy because it is made from 100% natural materials -- nothing artificial, no alloy metals or synthetic bonding agents. Unlike other traditional cookware, it is non-reactive, which means it will not release fumes or cause 'leaching' of harmful metals into your food. 11 1/2"d<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 10px;"><li>Original Price $50</li>	EOL:EOL

He would see these farms when going with his father and grandfather who were milkmen. The bottom reflects the shape of egg-gathering baskets, the size and body of the basket are similar to baskets used for measuring and gathering, and the neck and top were inspired by the old milk cans they picked up at the farms and delivered to the dairy. The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation.

Consultant	575	P	25%	575	575	13239	Core Products	Baskets & Accessories	Master's Studio™ Circle of Life Basket	13239.jpg	Master Basketmaker Brian Dilts was inspired to design the Master's Studio™ Circle of Life Basket by the objects that hard-working farm families used every day. He would see these farms when going with his father and grandfather who were milkmen. The bottom reflects the shape of egg-gathering baskets, the size and body of the basket are similar to baskets used for measuring and gathering, and the neck and top were inspired by the old milk cans they picked up at the farms and delivered to the dairy. The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation. Made in the U.S.A. 10"d x 12"h; Rec. Wt. Use: 15 lbs. This basket is crafted for you when your order is placed. Please allow 12 weeks. See your Home Consultant for details.

He would see these farms when going with his father and grandfather who were milkmen. The bottom reflects the shape of egg-gathering baskets, the size and body of the basket are similar to baskets used for measuring and gathering, and the neck and top were inspired by the old milk cans they picked up at the farms and delivered to the dairy. The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation. Made in the U.S.A. 10"d x 12"h; Rec. Wt. Use: 15 lbs. This basket is crafted for you when your order is placed. Please allow 12 weeks. See your Home Consultant for details.

Customer	575		%	575	575	13239	Core Products	PCTOP	Master's Studio™ Circle of Life Basket	13239.jpg	Master Basketmaker Brian Dilts was inspired to design the Master's Studio™ Circle of Life Basket by the objects that hard-working farm families used every day. He would see these farms when going with his father and grandfather who were milkmen. The bottom reflects the shape of egg-gathering baskets, the size and body of the basket are similar to baskets used for measuring and gathering, and the neck and top were inspired by the old milk cans they picked up at the farms and delivered to the dairy. The Circle of Life Basket is a tribut to genereations of family farms and the cycle of springtime and harvest, planting and reaping; the circles around the neck of the basket represent the continuation of these cycles from generation to generation.

Employee	45	P	50%	45	45	1326474	Core Products	PCTOP	2016 Horizon of Hope® Basket Animal Welfare Orange	1326474.jpg	Over the past 20 years, Longaberger’s Horizon of Hope® has raised over $17 million for breast cancer research and touched more than 20 million lives with a unique message of hope. If a small pink basket can do that much good for so many — just imagine how much good a rainbow of baskets can do? This year, Horizon of Hope is proud to feature five colors of baskets, each dedicated to supporting a unique and worthy cause! While we have identified the 2016 causes as Breast Cancer (Pink), Heart Health (Red), Alzheimer’s (Purple), Autism (Blue) and Animal Welfare (Orange), the final recipients are up to you. Longaberger will dedicate $2 from each Horizon of Hope Basket sold to the cause of the corresponding color. We invite you, our Longaberger community, to nominate a qualified 501(c)(3) organization that you want considered as a Horizon of Hope recipient.

Flameware® 10 1/2" Lidded Braiser Ebony	32182150.jpg	The Longaberger Flameware Braiser is perfect to store in the refrigerator or freezer, then warm up in the microwave or oven. Braising (from the French 'braiser') is a combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat; typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid, resulting in a particular flavor. The Flameware lids have dimples, or spikes on the inside and are part of the lid's self basting design. Dimples allow condensation that naturally occurs during cooking to collect and release directly back into the food. The underside of most other lids are flat, which directs the condensation down the side of the pan, where it pools at the bottom. 10 1/2"d x 2 1/2"h; 72 oz.; includes silicone grips. <span style="color: green;">Available through August 31, 2015</span> 	EOL:EOL

Braising (from the French 'braiser') is a combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat; typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid, resulting in a particular flavor. The Flameware lids have dimples, or spikes on the inside and are part of the lid's self basting design. Dimples allow condensation that naturally occurs during cooking to collect and release directly back into the food. The underside of most other lids are flat, which directs the condensation down the side of the pan, where it pools at the bottom. 10 1/2"d x 2 1/2"h; 72 oz.
